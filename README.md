# k-nearest-neighbors-Classifier
In this project, I will build a classification model that guesses whether a movie is a comedy or a thriller by using only the number of times chosen words appear in the movie's screenplay. By the end of the project, I'll show how to:

1. Build a k-nearest-neighbors classifier.
2. Test a classifier
